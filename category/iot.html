</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This week I haven't made as much progress as I wanted, but I have learned some valuable lessons. While trying to get my ESP8266 working with SCL/SDA on the BME280, I was finding that I couldn't see the device. I was attempting to use a couple of BME280. This was not working as expected. I attached an LED to the positive and negative to make sure that I was getting power, and it seemed to be okay. Then yesterday, I decided to move some of the circuits around and remove the extra components I had already added last week, but after this, I couldn't even get the LED to light up. This morning I had got to the point of thinking that my ESP8266 might be faulty. I decided to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/multimeters">learn how to use my multimeter</a>, which I purchased long ago. Follow through the tutorial on Adafruit if you don't know how, and keep it bookmarked for later. I have only used the continuity check and voltage check so far. The numbers that you're selecting on the voltage check are an "up to" number by the way. If you see a reading of 1, you've probably got the wrong setting.</p>
<p>It turns out that using the feather connector and not soldering the joints makes for a terrible connection. I should have some solder arriving tomorrow, so I'm expecting some more progress next week. I'm looking forward to some exciting learning experiences with soldering.</p>
<p>In other news, I've been continuing with my daily touch typing practice. I've been using a Pomodoro timer, with one session 25-minute session in the morning and one 25 minute session in the evening. I've been improving noticeably over time. I'm now consistently between 50 and 60 words per minute. I'm aiming to get above 70 words per minute, before treating myself to a mechanical keyboard. I may even decide to try making this myself.</p>                </article>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>This week and last week I've been making a weather station using an ESP8266
Microcontroller. I started out using the Adafruit learning resource for this,
which gives an excellent overview if you want to get everything working and
don't want to customise anything. I want to customise several different things â€¦</p>
