</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This week and last week I've been making a weather station using an ESP8266
Microcontroller. I started out using the Adafruit learning resource for this,
which gives an excellent overview if you want to get everything working and
don't want to customise anything. I want to customise several different things
for my weather station, and I want to write some more of the code myself
because I like writing code, and I want to know more about how everything is
working.</p>
<p>Below, I talk about some of the challenges I faced, along with some of the
changes to my design I went through as I learnt more about what I was doing.
This week I'm going to cover buying the components through to getting a
Micropython REPL on the ESP8266 microcontroller.</p>
<h2>Buying the components</h2>
<p>Get all of the components from the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-air-quality-monitor#">Adafruit Article</a>.
If you're in the UK though, don't buy your components from the Adafruit store. They're a great
company with great learning resources, but you're much better off buying from
<a href="https://thepihut.com/">The Pi Hut</a>. The Pi Hut is cheaper than the
alternatives (like Amazon), and they also seem to have some good learning
resources that you're supporting. I ended up buying my first bunch of
components from Adafruit and had to pay roughly Â£20 in fees. If you're in the
US, go for it. They're a great company, and we should support them as much as
possible.</p>
<p>I also bought myself a few extra components on top of the suggested items. The
first was a breadboard. I did have one of these, but I lent it to my Dad. He's
still using it for his model railway, so I bought myself a new one. I also got
myself a bundle of male to male cables for ease of use with the breadboard.</p>
<p>The other thing to mention is, I suspect some solder is needed, but I haven't
got that far as of writing this. I'll be sure to come back and edit this once
I know.</p>
<h2>Wiring</h2>
<p>For the wiring, I followed the
<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-air-quality-monitor/arduino-wiring-and-assembly">Adafruit Article's Wiring and Assembly section</a>
exactly. Electronics isn't my area of expertise, and I want to learn more here.</p>
<h2>Getting the ESP 8266 to talk to the MAC</h2>
<p>My Mac didn't have the correct drivers. Before finding anything to install, I
checked I could connect a different board. I had a Circuit Playground Express
which connected, so I was sure my USB cable was ok, and the USB port on my Mac
was ok. Download the driver from
<a href="https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers">Silicon Labs</a>.</p>
<p>You should then see your device with the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ll /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART
</pre></div>


<h2>Installing Micropython</h2>
<p>The next step was to install Micropython. This step requires installing
esptool. You need a working version of python with pip. I installed it within a
virtualenv.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install esptool
</pre></div>


<p>After that, you need to <a href="http://www.micropython.org/download">download Micropython</a>.
You can then use esptool tool to erase the current flash:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">esptool</span> <span class="c1">--port /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART erase_flash</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and write the new image:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">esptool</span> <span class="c1">--port /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART write_flash 0 ~/Downloads/esp8266-20190125-v1.10.bin</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Connecting to the ESP 8266</h2>
<p>First, find out your username:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">whoami</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In my example, this is roberthughes. Add yourself to the wheel group to give
yourself permission to read and write to your device.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">dscl</span> <span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">append</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Groups</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">wheel</span> <span class="n">GroupMembership</span> <span class="n">roberthughes</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You also need to change the permissions for your <code>uucp</code> directory to allow you
to write the lock, allowing only one connection to your device at a time.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">chmod</span> <span class="mi">775</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">spool</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">uucp</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, you'll need to log out and log back into your account for the group
change to take effect, then run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cu</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">cu</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">SLAB_USBtoUART</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="mi">115200</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You should then be able to run python code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;hello&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
